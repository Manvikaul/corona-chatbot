            "This article was updated on May 7, 2020 Coronaviruses typically affect the respiratory tracts of birds and mammals, including humans. Doctors associate them with the common cold, bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These viruses can also affect the gut. Coronaviruses usually cause the common cold, though they can be responsible for more severe illnesses. Over the past 70 years, scientists have found that these viruses can infect mice, rats, dogs, cats, turkeys, horses, pigs, and cattle. Sometimes, these animals transmit the viruses to humans. Most recently, authorities identified a new coronavirus outbreak in China that has now reached other countries. The virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and it can cause COVID-19. In this article, we explain the different types of human coronavirus, their symptoms, and how people transmit them. We also focus on three particularly dangerous diseases caused by coronaviruses: COVID-19, SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment.\n",

Researchers first identified a coronavirus in 1937, isolating one that was responsible for a type of bronchitis in birds that had the potential to devastate poultry stocks. Scientists found evidence of human coronaviruses in the 1960s, in the noses of people with the common cold.\n",

            "Human coronaviruses that are particularly prevalent include 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. The name “coronavirus” comes from the crown-like projections on their surfaces. “Corona” in Latin means “halo” or “crown.” Among humans, coronavirus infections most often occur during the winter months and early spring.\n",

            "COVID-19 In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started monitoring the outbreak of a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Authorities first identified the virus in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has spread to nearly every country, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic. The new coronavirus has been responsible for millions of infections globally, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. The United States has seen the highest number of these deaths. The first people with COVID-19 had links to an animal and seafood market. This suggests that animals initially transmitted the virus to humans. Then, people with no connections to the market developed the disease, confirming that humans can pass the virus to each other. Read about how pangolins could be the source of COVID-19 here. On February 17, 2020, the director-general of the WHO presented the following updated estimates of the severity of COVID-19 cases, using data from 44,000 people who had received confirmed diagnoses: Stage of severity Rough percentage of people with COVID-19 mild disease more than 80% severe disease, causing breathlessness and pneumonia around 14% critical disease, causing septic shock, respiratory failure, and the failure of more than one organ about 5% fatal disease 2% The WHO report that the two groups most at risk of experiencing severe illness due to a SARS-CoV-2 infection are older adults and people who have other health conditions that compromise their immune systems. According to the CDC, children are not at higher risk of COVID-19 than adults.
