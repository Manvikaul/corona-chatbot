cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.\\n\\nthe best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the covid-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. \\n\\nthe covid-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).\\n\\nat this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for covid-19. however, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. who will continue to provide updated information

you have serious symptoms.  always call before visiting your doctor or health facility. \\n\\npeople with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home. \\n\\non average it takes 5â€“6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days. \\ncoronaviruses are a group of related rna viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. in humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which is caused also by certain other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause sars, mers, and covid-19. symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. there are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.\\n\\ncoronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2).[9] it was first identified in december 2019 in wuhan, china, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic.[10][11] as of 9 may 2020, more than 3.95 million cases have been reported across 187 countries and territories, resulting in more than 275,000 deaths. more than 1.31 million people have recovered.[8]\\n\\ncommon symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.[5][12][13] while the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.[14][15][16] the time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.[5][17]\\n\\nthe virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,[a] often via small droplets produced by coughing,[b] sneezing, and talking.[6][18][20] the droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than remaining in the air over long distances.[6] people may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.[6][18] on surfaces, the amount of virus declines over time until it is insufficient to remain infectious, but it may be detected for hours or days.[6][20][21] it is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.[22] the standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rrt-pcr) from a nasopharyngeal swab.[23] chest ct imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, guidelines do not recommend using it for routine screening.[24][25]\\n\\nrecommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others (especially from those with symptoms), quarantine, covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.[26][27][7] in addition, the use of a face covering is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.[28][29] recommendations for face covering use by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending, some recommending against, and others requiring their use.[29][30][31] there is limited evidence for or against the use of masks (medical or other) in healthy individuals in the wider community.[6]\\n\\naccording to the world health organization, there are no available vaccines nor specific antiviral treatments for covid-19.[6] on 1 may 2020, the united states gave emergency use authorization to the antiviral remdesivir for people hospitalized with severe covid-19.[32] management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.[33] the world health organization (who) declared the covid-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (pheic)[34][35] on 30 january 2020 and a pandemic on 11 march 2020.[11] local transmission of the disease has occurred in most countries across all six who regions.[36]\\nsigns and symptoms\\nsymptoms of covid-19[4]\\nsymptom\\trange\\nfever\\t83â€“99%\\ncough\\t59â€“82%\\nloss

people and those with other health problems experience fever later in the disease.[4][37] in one study, 44% of people had fever when they presented to the hospital, while 89% went on to develop fever at some point during their hospitalization.[4][38]\\n\\nother common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains.[4][5][1][39] symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.[40][41][42] less common symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat.[43]\\n\\nsome cases in china initially presented with only chest tightness and palpitations.[44]\\n\\na decreased sense of smell or disturbances in taste may occur.[45][46] loss of smell was a presenting symptom in 30% of confirmed cases in south korea.[13][47]\\n\\nas is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person is first infected and the time he or she develops symptoms. this is called the incubation period. the incubation period for covidâ€‘19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days,[48][49] although 97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.[50]\\n\\na minority of cases do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[51][52] these asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested, and their role in transmission is not yet fully known.[53][54] however, preliminary evidence suggests they may contribute to the spread of the disease.[55][56] in march 2020, the korea centers for disease control and prevention (kcdc) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.[56][57]\\n\\ncomplications\\ncomplications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death.[58][59][60][61][62] cardiovascular-related complications may include heart failure, irregular electrical activity, blood clots, and heart inflammation.[63] approximately 20-30% of people who present with covidâ€‘19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases) reflecting liver injury.[64][65] neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and guillainâ€“barrã© syndrome.[66]\\n\\nchildren may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome following the acute infection and die.[67]\\ntransmission\\ncough/sneeze droplets visualised in dark background using tyndall scattering\\nrespiratory droplets produced when a man sneezes, visualised using tyndall scattering\\nfile:covid19 in numbers- r0, the case fatality rate and why we need to flatten the curve.webm\\na video discussing the basic reproduction number and case fatality rate in the context of the pandemic\\ncovid-19 is a new disease, and the ways it spreads between people are under investigation, including: the role of small droplets, the extent and how it may be transmitted through air, and how long the virus remains infectious on surfaces.[6][18][20] the disease is spread during close contact, often by small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking.[6][20] during close contact, (1 to 2 metres, 3 to 6 feet), people catch the disease after breathing in contaminated droplets that were exhaled by infected people. however, the droplets are relatively heavy and usually fall to the ground or surfaces, as opposed to being infectious over large distances.[6][20]\\n\\nafter the droplets fall to floors or surfaces, they still can infect other people, if they touch contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.[6] on surfaces the amount of active virus decreases over time until it can no longer cause infection.[20] specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for one day on cardboard, for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (aisi 304) and for up to four hours on 99% copper.[21][20][68] surfaces are easily decontaminated with household disinfectants which kill the virus outside the human body or on the hands.[6] disinfectants or bleach are not a treatment for covid-19, and cause health problems when not used properly, such as inside the human body.[69]\\n\\nsputum and saliva carry large amounts of virus.[70][6][18][20] some medical procedures may result in the virus being transmitted easier than normal for such small droplets, known as airborne transmission.[6][20]\\n\\nthe virus is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread is known to occur up to two days before symptoms appear (presymptomatic transmission) and in later stages of the disease.[18][20][71][72] some people have been infected and recovered without showing symptoms, but uncertainties remain in terms of asymptomatic transmission.[20]\\n\\nalthough covid-19 is not a sexually transmitted infection, kissing, intimate contact, and faecal oral routes are suspected to transmit the virus.[73][74]\\nprevention\\nsee also: covid-19 pandemic â§ prevention, flatten the curve, and workplace hazard controls for covid-19\\n\\nprogressively stronger mitigation efforts to reduce the number of active cases at any given timeâ€”known as \"flattening the curve\"â€”allows healthcare services to better manage the same volume of patients.[119][120][121] likewise, progressively greater increases in healthcare capacityâ€”called raising the lineâ€”such as by increasing bed count, personnel, and equipment, helps to meet increased demand.[122]\\n\\nmitigation attempts that are inadequate in strictness or durationâ€”such as premature relaxation of distancing rules or stay-at-home ordersâ€”can allow a resurgence after the initial surge and mitigation.[120][123]\\npreventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[124][125][126] the cdc recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.[124] proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.[124] the cdc has recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals.[127] the u.s. national institutes of health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of covidâ€‘19, before or after exposure to the sars-cov-2 virus, outside of the setting of a clinical trial.[128]\\n\\nsocial distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.[129] distancing guidelines also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.[130] there is no medication known to be effective at preventing covidâ€‘19.[131] after the implementation of social distancing and stay-at-home orders, many regions have been able to sustain an effective transmission rate (\"rt\") of less than one, meaning the disease is in remission in those areas.[132] in a simple model {\\\\textstyle log(r_{t})\\\\approx r_{t}-1}{\\\\textstyle log(r_{t})\\\\approx r_{t}-1} needs on average over time be kept at or below zero to avoid exponential growth.[citation needed]\\n\\nas a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest,[133] a key part of managing covidâ€‘19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as \"flattening the curve\".[120] this is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of current cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available.[120][123]\\n\\naccording to the who, the use of masks is recommended only if a person is coughing or sneezing or when one is taking care of someone with a suspected infection.[134] for the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc) face masks \"... could be considered especially when visiting busy closed spaces ...\" but \"... only as a complementary measure ...\"[135] several countries have recommended that healthy individuals wear face masks or cloth face coverings (like scarves or bandanas) at least in certain public settings, including china,[136] hong kong,[137] spain,[138] italy (lombardy region),[139] russia,[140] and the united states.[127]\\n\\nthose diagnosed with covidâ€‘19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the cdc to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider\\'s office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.[28][141] the cdc also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one\\'s nose, coughing or sneezing. it further recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.[124]\\n\\nfor areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the who provides two formulations for local production. in these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol. hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is \"not an active substance for hand antisepsis\". glycerol is added as a humectant.[142]\\nprotective equipment\\nsee also: covid-19 related shortages\\n\\nthe cdc recommends four steps to putting on personal protective equipment (ppe).[167]\\nprecautions must be taken to minimise the risk of virus transmission, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.[168] for healthcare professionals caring for people with covidâ€‘19, the cdc recommends placing the person in an airborne infection isolation room (aiir) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions.[169]\\n\\nthe cdc outlines the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (ppe) during the pandemic. the recommended gear is a ppe gown, respirator or facemask, eye protection, and medical gloves.[170][171]\\n\\nwhen available, respirators (instead of facemasks) are preferred.[172] n95 respirators are approved for industrial settings but the fda has authorised the masks for use under an emergency use authorisation (eua). they are designed to protect from airborne particles like dust but effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for off-label uses.[173] when masks are not available, the cdc recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.[174]\\nthe severity of covidâ€‘19 varies. the disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks.[43]\\n\\nchildren make up a small proportion of reported cases, with about 1% of cases being under 10 years and 4% aged 10â€“19 years.[20] they are likely to have milder symptoms and a lower chance of severe disease than adults; in those younger than 50 years the risk of death is less than 0.5%, while in those older than 70 it is more than 8%.[216][217][218] pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe infection with covid-19 based on data from other similar viruses, like sars and mers, but data for covid-19 is lacking.[219][220] in china, children acquired infections mainly through close contact with their parents or other family members who lived in wuhan or had traveled there.[216]\\n\\nsome studies have found that the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (nlr) may be helpful in early screening for severe illness.[221]\\n\\nmost of those who die of covidâ€‘19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.[222] the istituto superiore di sanitã\\xa0 reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available for review, 97.2% of sampled patients had at least one comorbidity with the average patient having 2.7 diseases.[223] according to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five being spent hospitalised. however, patients transferred to an icu had a median time of seven days between hospitalisation and death.[223] in a study of early cases, the median time from exhibiting initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.[224] in a study by the national health commission (nhc) of china, men had a death rate of 2.8% while women had a death rate of 1.7%.[225] histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs. viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes. the lung picture resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards).[43] in 11.8% of the deaths reported by the national health commission of china, heart damage was noted by elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.[44] according to march data from the united states, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions.[226]\\n\\nthe availability of medical resources and the socioeconomics of a region may also affect mortality.[227] estimates of the mortality from the condition vary because of those regional differences,[228] but also because of methodological difficulties. the under-counting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.[229] however, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past can mean the current mortality rate is underestimated.[230][231] smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of covidâ€‘19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.[232]\\n\\nconcerns have been raised about long-term sequelae of the disease. the hong kong hospital authority found a drop of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.[233] this may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.[234]\\n\\ncase fatality rates (%) by age and country\\nage\\t0â€“9\\t10â€“19\\t20â€“29\\t30â€“39\\t40â€“49\\t50â€“59\\t60â€“69\\t70â€“79\\t80-89\\t90+\\ncanada as of 5

disease.[249][250] some of the infected have been reported to develop protective antibodies, so acquired immunity is presumed likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses.[251] however, cases in which recovery from covidâ€‘19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date have been reported.[252][253][254][255] these cases are believed to be lingering infection rather than reinfection,[255] or false positives due to remaining rna fragments.[256] some other coronaviruses circulating in people are capable of reinfection after roughly a year.[257][258]\\n\\nhistory\\nmain article: timeline of the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic\\nthe virus is thought to be natural and has an animal origin,[76] through spillover infection.[259] the actual origin is unknown, but the first known cases of infection happened in china. by december 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.[211][260] a study of the first 41 cases of confirmed covidâ€‘19, published in january 2020 in the lancet, revealed the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 december 2019.[261][262][263] official publications from the who reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 december 2019.[264] human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the who and chinese authorities by 20 january 2020.[265][266]\\ninfection fatality rate\\nour world in data states that as of march 25, 2020, the infection fatality rate (ifr) cannot be accurately calculated.[274] in february, the world health organization estimated the ifr at 0.94%, with a confidence interval between 0.37 percent to 2.9 percent.[275] the university of oxford centre for evidence-based medicine (cebm) estimated a global cfr of 0.72 percent and ifr of 0.1 percent to 0.36 percent.[276] according to cebm, random antibody testing in germany suggested an ifr of 0.37% (0.12% to 0.87%) there, but there have been concerns about false positives.[276][277][278][1] firm lower limits of infection fatality rates have been established in a number of locations. in new york city, with a population of 8.4 million, as of may 7, 14,162 (0.17% of the population) have died from covid-19.[279] in bergamo province, where 0.57% of the population has died.[280][281][282] to get a better view on the number of people infected initial antibody testing have been carried out, but there are no valid scientific reports based on any of them as of yet.[283][284]\\n\\nsex differences\\nmain article: gendered impact of the covid-19 pandemic\\nthe impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.[285] mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in china and italy.[1][286][287] the higher risk for men appears in their 50s, and begins to taper off only at 90.[287] in china, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.[287] the exact reasons for this sex-difference are not known, but genetic and behavioural factors could be a reason.[285] sex-based immunological differences, a lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.[287] in europe, of those infected with covidâ€‘19, 57% were men; of those infected with covidâ€‘19 who also died, 72% were men.[288] as of april 2020, the u.s. government is not tracking sex-related data of covidâ€‘19 infections.[289] research has shown that viral illnesses like ebola, hiv, influenza, and sars affect men and women differently.[289] a higher percentage of health workers, particularly nurses, are women, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.[290] school closures, lockdowns, and reduced access to healthcare following the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic may differentially affect the genders and possibly exaggerate existing gender disparity.[285][291]\\n\\nethnic differences\\nin the u.s., a greater proportion of deaths due to covid-19 have occurred among african americans.[292] structural factors that prevent african americans from practicing social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and \"essential\" occupations such as public transit employees and health-care workers. greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care and of underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease also increase their risk of death.[293] similar issues affect native american and latino communities.[292] leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities.[294]\\n\\nexisting respiratory problems\\nwhen someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with covid-19, they are at greater risk for severe symptoms.[295] covid-19 also poses a greater risk to people who misuse opioids and methamphetamines, insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage.[296]\\nvaccine\\nmain article: covid-19 vaccine\\nthere is no available vaccine, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates. previous work on sars-cov is being used because both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 use the ace2 receptor to enter human cells.[326] three vaccination strategies are being investigated. first, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. the use of such a virus, be it inactive or dead, aims to elicit a prompt immune response of the human body to a new infection with covidâ€‘19. a second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. in the case of sars-cov-2, such research focuses on the s-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the ace2 enzyme receptor. a third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines (dna or rna vaccines, a novel technique for creating a vaccination). experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.[327]\\n\\non 16 march 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in seattle, united states. the vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.[328]\\n\\nantibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge for vaccine development for sars-cov-2, but this is controversial.[329]\\n\\nmedications\\nmain article: covid-19 drug repurposing research\\nat least 29 phase iiâ€“iv efficacy trials in covidâ€‘19 were concluded in march 2020 or scheduled to provide results in april from hospitals in china.[330][331] there are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of april 2020.[131] seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.[331] repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the chinese research, with nine phase iii trials on remdesivir across several countries due to report by the end of april.[330][331] other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.[331]\\n\\nthe covidâ€‘19 clinical research coalition has goals to 1) facilitate rapid reviews of clinical trial proposals by ethics committees and national regulatory agencies, 2) fast-track approvals for the candidate therapeutic compounds, 3) ensure standardised and rapid analysis of emerging efficacy and safety data and 4) facilitate sharing of clinical trial outcomes before publication.[332][333]\\n\\nseveral existing medications are being evaluated for the treatment of covidâ€‘19,[188] including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.[324][334] there is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir, as of march 2020.[335][336] clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate-use remdesivir.[337] remdesivir inhibits sars-cov-2 in vitro.[338] phase iii clinical trials are underway in the u.s., china, and italy.[188][330][339]\\n\\nin 2020, a trial found that lopinavir/ritonavir was ineffective in the treatment of severe illness.[340] nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low concentration inhibition of sars-cov-2.[338]\\n\\nthere are mixed results as of 3 april 2020 as to the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for covidâ€‘19, with some studies showing little or no improvement.[341][342] the studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from embracing these therapies without further study.[131]\\n\\noseltamivir does not inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro and has no known role in covidâ€‘19 treatment.[131]'"
